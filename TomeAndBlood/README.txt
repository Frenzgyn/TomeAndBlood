Tome And Blood: More Options for Wizards and Sorcerers v0.9.3

## Overview

Tome and Blood is a mod that revises and expands the class options for Mages and Sorcerers. This mod began as the Sorcerous Origins kitpack, which took advantage of the newly added Sorcerer kit options to add several kits to Sorcerers. It has since grown into a mod that makes changes to all Mage and Sorcerer kits, spells and items as well as adding dozens of new kits, abilities and functionality. 
 
##Features

COMPONENT 11: Rebalanced Spell Schools

This component changes the school of various spells, to make sure there is at least one spell at each level in each school, and that specialists of different schools are better-balanced against one another.

COMPONENT 13: Revised Illusionary Clones

This component makes Mislead and Project Image work just as Simulacrum does, except the clones can use more magic as you go up in level, and the caster gets progressively better invisibility at the same time:

5th Level: Mislead - clone is a pure image, cannot attack or cast spells. Caster become normal invisible - NOT super-Mislead-invisible.
6th Level: Shadow Clone - clone has 40% hit points and -7 to thac0 and caster level, can cast only 1st-level arcane spells, cannot cast divine spells.
7th Level: Lesser Simulacrum - clone has 60% hit points and -5 to thac0 and caster level, can cast up to 4th-level arcane spells, cannot cast divine spells.
8th Level: Simulacrum - clone has 75% hit points and -3 to thac0 and caster level, and can cast any spells.
9th Level: Projected Simulacrum - cast Simulacrum on another creature. (Illusionists only)

COMPONENT 14: Revised Invisiblity

This component merges the effects of Invisibility and Sanctuary (you can now loot chests and open doors while invisible :) ).  The upshot is, if you cast 2nd-level Detect Invisible, the caster will be able to see and target invisible enemies but other party members who cannot see invisible cannot.  It also replaces the 3rd-level arcane spell "Detect Illusions" with the 3rd-level divine spell "Invisibility Purge."

COMPONENT 16: Revised Identify Spell

This component changes Identify into a 2nd-level spell, and allows it to scale with level, such that at 15th level the caster can identify 4 items with a single casting of the spell. (NB: this involves modifications to the UI. It may not work with some UI overhauls installed beforehand, and it likely won't work with any UI overhauls installed afterward.)

COMPONENT 20: Revised Dragon Disciples

Adds new Dragon Disciple kits to the game, matching different varieties of dragon species.

COMPONENT 25: Magus

Adds the Magus sorcerer kit to the game, which can cast spells in heavy armor and use more weapons than a normal sorcerer.

COMPONENT 31: Favored Soul

Adds the Favored Soul sorcerer kit to the game.  This kit can choose a sphere of divine spells to cast, in addition to its normal arcane spell selection.

COMPONENT 33: Sylvan Disciple

Adds the Sylvan Disciple sorcerer kit to the game.  This kit is born of the fey folk, with immunities to charms and minor divination magic.

COMPONENT 35: Revenant Disciple

Adds the Revenant Disciple sorcerer kit to the game.  This kit carries the taint of the grave, with immunities to Sleep and death magic.

COMPONENT 37: Amorphous Disciple

Adds the Amorphous Disciple sorcerer kit to the game.  This kit is kind to oozes of all sorts, with immunities to poison and disease.

COMPONENT 40: Revised Specialists

This component defines specialists by what they can do, instead of by what they can't.  All specialists can cast all spells - there are no opposition schools.  And each specialist get some active or passive innate abilities that represent their mastery over their particular school of magic.  Finally, specialists gain the ability to spontaneously convert any of their memorized spells into a spell from their specialty school of one level lower.  The special abilities are:
- Abjurer: when you cast a spell protection, it automatically creates a Spell Shield for free.
- Conjurer: if SR is installed, you can cast Monster Summoning spells as if they are one level lower.
- Diviner: IIRC, you get innate (and early) access to Contingency. Might also be able to insert one extra spell into contingencies (two spells in Contingency, three in Chain Contingency).
- Enchanter: the enchanter and all nearby allies get a +1 bonus to saves vs. spells.
- Illusionist: you can use the Shadow Step ability, and have permanent Non-Detection.
- Invoker: your spells do 20% more fire, cold, electric and magic damage.
- Necromancer: you can innately use a modal ability to slow or control nearby undead. Also, the Chill Touch, Ghoul Touch, and Vampiric Touch spells are improved to have special effects against undead, and they are changed into innate abilities only learnable by necromancers.
- Transmuter: you get the innate ability to temporarily create and control a golem.

COMPONENT 45: Arcane Crafting

This component allows wizards to create scrolls, wands, and potions, by expending XP and/or gold.

COMPONENT 48: Armored Casting for Bards

Bards can cast spells in leather armor.

COMPONENTS 51, 52, 53, 54, 55: Innate Metamagic

The first four of these components make spell sequencers and contingencies into innate abilities (Chain Contingency becomes an HLA) so they don't cost spell slots; but "filling" them with spells still uses the spell slots associated with those spells.  These four components differ according to how you get metamagic (automatically as you level up, or learned from scrolls) and whether or not sorcerers can use metamagic spells.

The 5th version leaves sequencers and contingencies as spells you must memorize, but when you cast them, you "fill" them with any spell you *know,* without expending any memorization slots. 

COMPONENTS 61, 62, 63: Cantrips

Component 61 allows mages and sorcerers to use one cantrip as an innate ability with unlimited uses.

Component 62 allows mages and sorcerers and bards to cast an unlimited number of 1st-level spells without needing to rest. Some spells are slightly rebalanced or moved to 2nd level to account for this.

Component 63 gives you a "wand" that you equip in a weapon slot, which allows you to use one of eight cantrips as item abilities with unlimited uses.

COMPONENTS 66-69: Revised Familiars

Component 66 makes Find Familiar an innate ability and replaces its scrolls with scrolls of Magic Missile.

Component 67 allows you to choose which familiar you want (from a slightly modified list) instead of being bound by your alignment.  Currently, the available familiars are Pseudodragon, Ferret, Rabbit, Cat, Spider, and Rat.  Each ahs its own special skills and abilities, and each provides a different small passive benefit to the caster.

Component 68 allows you to imbue your familiar with up to five spells (one each from spell levels 1 through 5, from your known spells).  The familiar will be able to cast each spell as an innate ability, once every three turns.

Component 69 eliminates the hp damage and CON loss you take when a familiar dies.  So you can re-summon/revive the familiar without penalty, once per day.  As a consequence, this also eliminates the flat hit point bonus you get from summoning a familiar.  Instead, you will get a 15% boost to your max hit points, whenever your familiar is out of yoru pack and within your general vicinity.

COMPONENTS 71, 72: Spell Switching for Sorcerers

This gives you an innate ability to switch out one of your known spells.  You can choose whether to get the ability once every level, or once every three levels.  In order for this to work, you will have to choose known spells from an item ability, like multiclass sorcerers, rather then in the traditional level-up screens.  Make sure you install this component after any other sorcerer kit mods!

COMPONENT 80: Multiclass Sorcerers

What it says on the tin :O

COMPONENT 82: Arcanist

This is a mage kit which can learn spells from scrolls, like other wizards; but after using an innate ability to prepare spells for the next day, can cast their memorized spells spontaneously, like a sorcerer.  Whereas traditional wizards have a certain amount of known spells, and an identical set of memorization slots and casting slots; and whereas sorcerers have an identical set of known/memorized spells and a distinct number of casting slots; with the Arcanist known spells, memorization slots, and casting slots are all different.  The number of memorization slots equals those of a non-specialist wizard; the number of casting slots equals those of a Dragon Disciple.

COMPONENT 80: Mana Sorcerer

This component gives sorcerers (only unkitted sorcerers, for now) an innate ability to use mana points to cast spells instead of spell-level-based casting slots.  Your known spells will be the same (you must choose them manually from an item ability) but you will have a pool of mana points instead of spell slots.  Casting a spell costs as many points as its spell level; you will start with ~2 mana points and can progress to as many as 120, at level 25.  While more flexible, this is generally less firepower than a normal sorcerer has if you tally up their spell slots; so the Mana Sorcerer has a Restorative Meditation innate ability that can be used between fights, which will restore one half of the points you recently spent, rounded down.

COMPONENT 93: Bonus Spell Slot Items Work With Arcanists and Multiclass Sorcerers

What it sounds like.

COMPONENT 95: Ability Score-Based Bonus Spells

This component gives bonus spells to wizards for high INT scores, and to bards and sorcerers for high CHA scores.  The bonuses go up to +2 spell slots per spell level, up to 7th-level spells for wizards, up to 6th-level spells for bards, and up to 5th-level spells for sorcerers.

Any mod component that changes the game's spell tables (such as, say, Tweaks Anthology) should be installed BEFORE this component.

The Scales of Balance mod now has a component which matches this exactly; if it is easier, you can skip the one here and install it via SoB after any spell table-altering mods.
