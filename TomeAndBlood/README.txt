Tome And Blood: More Options for Wizards and Sorcerers v0.8

## Overview
Tome and Blood is a mod that revises and expands the class options for Mages and Sorcerers. This mod began as the Sorcerous Origins kitpack, which took advantage of the newly added Sorcerer kit options to add several kits to Sorcerers. It has since grown into a mod that makes changes to all Mage and Sorcerer kits, spells and items as well as adding dozens of new kits, abilities and functionality. 
 
##Features
COMPONENT 5: Rebalanced Spell Schools

This component changes the school of various spells, to make sure there is at least one spell at each level in each school, and that specialists of different schools are better-balanced against one another.

COMPONENT 10: General Spell Tweaks

COMPONENT 11: Revised Illusionary Clones

This component makes Mislead and Project Image work just as Simulacrum does, except the clones can use more magic as you go up in level, and the caster gets progressively better invisibility at the same time:

6th Level: Shadow Clone - clone is 60% of caster's level and can only cast 1st-level spells
7th Level: Misleading Clone - clone is 60% of caster's level and can cast up to 3rd-level spells; caster goes Invisible
8th Level: Projected Clone - clone is 60% of caster's level and can cast any spells; caster goes Improved Invisible
9th Level: Simulacrum: clone is full-power and can cast any spells; caster goes Improved Invisible

COMPONENT 12: Revised Invisiblity

This component merges the effects of Invisibility and Sanctuary (you can now loot chests while invisible :) ).  The upshot is, if you cast 2nd-level Detect Invisible, the caster will be able to see and target the invisible enemy but other party members who cannot see invisible cannot.

COMPONENTS 20, 30, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100: see readme for TnB v0.7

COMPONENT 110: Armored Casting for Bards

Bards can cast spells in leather armors.

COMPONENTS 131, 132, 133, 134, 135: Innate Metamagic

The first four of these components make spell sequencers and contingencies into innate abilities (Chain Contingency becomes an HLA) so they don't cost spell slots; but "filling" them with spells still uses the spell slots associated with those spells.

The 5th version leaves sequencers and contingencies as spells you must memorize, but when you cast them, you "fill" them with spells at no further cost. 

COMPONENTs 141, 142, 143: Cantrips

Component 141 allows mages and sorcerers to use one cantrip as an innate ability with unlimited uses.

Component 142 allows mages and sorcerers and bards to cast an unlimited number of 1st-level spells without needing to rest.  Some spells are slightly rebalanced to account for this.

Component 143 gives you a "wand" that you equip in a weapon slot, which allows you to use one of eight cantrips as item abilities with unlimited uses.

COMPONENT 150: Revised Specialists

This component defines specialists by what they can do, instead of by what they can't.  All specialists can cast all spells - there are no opposition schools.  And each specialist get some active or passive innate abilities that represent their mastery over their particular school of magic.  Finally, specialists gain the ability to spontaneously convert any of their memorized spells into a spell from their specialty school of one level lower.

COMPONENT 160: Ability Score-Based Bonus Spells

This component gives bonus spells to wizards for high INT scores, and to bards and sorcerers for high CHA scores, according to the TnB 0.7 readme.

COMPONENT 170: Sorcerer Spell Selection by Dialogue

This component has sorcerers learn spells by way of a dialogue instead of via the vanilla GUI interface, and (I believe) zeroes out SRCSPLKN.2da.  This enables the creation of custom spell lists for different sorcerer kits.  However, if I understand correctly, as of TnB 0.7, the added kits do not use custom lists.  (I think.)  So there is probably not much reason to use this component.  I think!  

COMPONENT 180: Multiclass Sorcerers
