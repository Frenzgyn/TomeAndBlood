Tome And Blood: More Options for Wizards and Sorcerers v0.8

## Overview

Tome and Blood is a mod that revises and expands the class options for Mages and Sorcerers. This mod began as the Sorcerous Origins kitpack, which took advantage of the newly added Sorcerer kit options to add several kits to Sorcerers. It has since grown into a mod that makes changes to all Mage and Sorcerer kits, spells and items as well as adding dozens of new kits, abilities and functionality. 
 
##Features

COMPONENT 5: Rebalanced Spell Schools

This component changes the school of various spells, to make sure there is at least one spell at each level in each school, and that specialists of different schools are better-balanced against one another.

COMPONENT 10: General Spell Tweaks

Buffs to Symbol: Fear, Shapechange, Black Blade of Disaster, and Energy Drain.  More to come, maybe.

COMPONENT 11: Revised Illusionary Clones

This component makes Mislead and Project Image work just as Simulacrum does, except the clones can use more magic as you go up in level, and the caster gets progressively better invisibility at the same time:

5th Level: Mislead - clone is a pure image, cannot attack or cast spells. Caster become normal invisible - NOT super-Mislead-invisible.
6th Level: Shadow Clone - clone has 40% hit points and -7 to thac0 and caster level, can cast only 1st-level arcane spells, cannot cast divine spells.
7th Level: Lesser Simulacrum - clone has 60% hit points and -5 to thac0 and caster level, can cast up to 4th-level arcane spells, cannot cast divine spells.
8th Level: Simulacrum - clone has 75% hit points and -3 to thac0 and caster level, and can cast any spells.
9th Level: Projected Simulacrum - cast Simulacrum on another creature.

COMPONENT 12: Revised Invisiblity

This component merges the effects of Invisibility and Sanctuary (you can now loot chests and open doors while invisible :) ).  The upshot is, if you cast 2nd-level Detect Invisible, the caster will be able to see and target invisible enemies but other party members who cannot see invisible cannot.  It also replaces the 3rd-level arcane spell "Detect Illusions" with the 3rd-level divine spell "Invisibility Purge."

COMPONENT 20: Revised Dragon Disciples

Adds new Dragon Disciple kits to the game, matching different varieties of dragon species.

COMPONENT 30: Magus

Adds the Magus sorcerer kit to the game, which can cast spells in heavy armor and use more weapons than a normal sorcerer.

COMPONENT 60: Favored Soul

Adds the Favored Soul sorcerer kit to the game.  This kit can choose a sphere of divine spells to cast, in addition to its normal arcane spell selection.

COMPONENT 70: Sylvan Disciple

Adds the Sylvan Disciple sorcerer kit to the game.  This kit is born of the fey folk, with immunities to charms and minor divination magic.

COMPONENT 80: Revenant Disciple

Adds the Revenant Disciple sorcerer kit to the game.  This kit carries the taint of the grave, with immunities to Sleep and death magic.

COMPONENT 90: Amorphous Disciple

Adds the Amorphous Disciple sorcerer kit to the game.  This kit is kind to oozes of all sorts, with immunities to poison and disease.

COMPONENT 110: Armored Casting for Bards

Bards can cast spells in leather armor.

COMPONENTS 131, 132, 133, 134, 135: Innate Metamagic

The first four of these components make spell sequencers and contingencies into innate abilities (Chain Contingency becomes an HLA) so they don't cost spell slots; but "filling" them with spells still uses the spell slots associated with those spells.

The 5th version leaves sequencers and contingencies as spells you must memorize, but when you cast them, you "fill" them with spells at no further cost. 

COMPONENTs 141, 142, 143: Cantrips

Component 141 allows mages and sorcerers to use one cantrip as an innate ability with unlimited uses.

Component 142 allows mages and sorcerers and bards to cast an unlimited number of 1st-level spells without needing to rest.  Some spells are slightly rebalanced to account for this.

Component 143 gives you a "wand" that you equip in a weapon slot, which allows you to use one of eight cantrips as item abilities with unlimited uses.

COMPONENT 150: Revised Specialists

This component defines specialists by what they can do, instead of by what they can't.  All specialists can cast all spells - there are no opposition schools.  And each specialist get some active or passive innate abilities that represent their mastery over their particular school of magic.  Finally, specialists gain the ability to spontaneously convert any of their memorized spells into a spell from their specialty school of one level lower.

COMPONENT 155: Innate Find Familiar

This component makes Find Familiar an innate ability and replaces its scrolls with scrolls of Magic Missile.

COMPONENT 160: Ability Score-Based Bonus Spells

This component gives bonus spells to wizards for high INT scores, and to bards and sorcerers for high CHA scores.  The bonuses go up to +2 spell slots per spell level, up to 7th-level spells for wizards, up to 6th-level spells for bards, and up to 5th-level spells for sorcerers.

Any mod component that changes the game's spell tables (such as, say, Tweaks Anthology) should be installed BEFORE this component.

COMPONENT 170: Sorcerer Spell Selection by Dialogue

This component has sorcerers learn spells by way of a dialogue instead of via the vanilla GUI interface, and (I believe) zeroes out SRCSPLKN.2da.  This enables the creation of custom spell lists for different sorcerer kits.  However, if I understand correctly, as of TnB 0.7, the added kits do not use custom lists.  (I think.)  So I'm not entirely sure what the utility of this is, *at the moment.*  

COMPONENT 180: Multiclass Sorcerers
