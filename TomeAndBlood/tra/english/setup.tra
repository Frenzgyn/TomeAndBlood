This spell creates a vivid, fan-shaped spray of clashing colors to spring forth from the caster's hand. Creatures within the area are affected in order of increasing distance from the wizard. All creatures in the area above the level of the caster or ones that have greater than 6 Hit Dice must make a Save vs. Spell. The spell's effects depend on the caster—creatures with Hit Dice/levels fewer than or equal to the caster are knocked unconscious for 5 rounds, those with Hit Dice/levels one or two greater than the wizard are blinded for 3 rounds, and any other creatures are stunned for 1 round.

(Necromancy)

Level: 1
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

A Spook spell enables the wizard to play upon natural fears to cause the target creature to perceive the caster as someone or something inimical, which then appears to advance upon it in a threatening manner. If the creature does not make a successful Save vs. Spell, it turns and flees at maximum speed as far from the wizard as possible. The creature suffers a Saving Throw penalty of -1 every 2 levels of the caster, up to a maximum of -6 at 12th level. Although the caster does not actually pursue the fleeing creature, a phantasm from its own mind does. Undead are completely unaffected.~

@706 = ~Stinking Cloud
(Conjuration)

Level: 2
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

Stinking Cloud creates a billowing mass of nauseous vapors up to 40 ft. away from the wizard. Any creature caught within the cloud must roll a successful Save vs. Poison or be reeling and fall unconscious for the next round. Those who make successful Saving Throws can leave the cloud without suffering any ill effects, although those remaining in the cloud must continue to save every round.~

@707 = ~Web
(Conjuration)

Level: 2
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 8 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 18-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

Web creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands, similar to spider webs but much larger and tougher. Anyone in the area when the spell is cast must roll a Save vs. Spell every round. If failed, the creature is paralyzed for one round. If the Saving Throw is successful, then the creature can move normally.~

@708 = ~Power Word, Sleep
(Enchantment)

Level: 2
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When a wizard calls upon a Power Word, Sleep spell, <PRO_HESHE> causes a comatose slumber to come upon 1 creature (other than undead and certain other creatures specifically excluded from the spell's effects). The creature targeted must have fewer than 20 Hit Points and gets no Saving Throw. Attacks against magically sleeping opponents never miss. The sleep effect will last for 5 rounds. This spell has no effect on creatures with more than 20 Hit Points.~ 

@709 = ~Ray of Enfeeblement
(Necromancy)

Level: 2
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

By means of a Ray of Enfeeblement, a wizard weakens an opponent, reducing its Strength and thereby the attacks that rely upon it. The victim is reduced to a Strength of 5 for the duration of the spell unless a Save vs. Spell is made. This spell does not affect combat bonuses due to magical items, and those conferring increased Strength function normally. However, the target receives all the penalties for 5 Strength, such as attack and damage penalties as well as lower weight allowance.~ 

@710 = ~Deafness
(Necromancy)

Level: 2
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature

The Deafness spell causes the recipient to become totally unable to hear any sounds. Deafened creatures are unaffected by spells and abilities that rely on hearing, and deafened spellcasters have a 50% chance to miscast any spells. The victim is allowed a Save vs. Spell to negate the effect. Deafness can be done away with by means of Dispel Magic, Cure Disease, and similar treatments.~

Only half of the fire damage is inflicted if the creature struck saves vs. Spell. The caster can fire one bolt for every five experience levels (two bolts at 10th level, three at 15th level, etc.).~

The wizard also gains 25% resistance to magic damage. While in wraithform, the caster cannot cast either arcane or divine spells.~

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1

Duration: 24 hours
Casting Time: 4

Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

The wizard instigates a teleportation effect that randomly teleports all enemies in this area for the duration of the spell. Teleport Field is best used against multiple enemies, throwing them into disarray and allowing the wizard to concentrate on activating <PRO_HISHER> defenses.~

@717 = ~Cloudkill
(Conjuration)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 18-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell generates a billowing cloud of ghastly yellowish green vapors that is so toxic as to slay any creature with 4 or fewer Hit Dice and force creatures with 5 or 6 Hit Dice to roll Saving Throws vs. Poison with -4 penalties or be slain. Holding one's breath has no effect on the lethality of the spell. Those above 6th level (or 6 Hit Dice) must leave the cloud immediately or suffer 1d10 points of poison damage each round while in the area of effect.~

@718 = ~Lower Resistance
(Enchantment)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Using this spell, a wizard can reduce the Magic Resistance of a target creature by 30% plus 1% per experience level of the caster. There is no Saving Throw, and the target’s Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~ 

@719 = ~Power Word, Silence
(Enchantment)

Level: 6
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 2 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the caster to utter one of the words of power. When spoken, Power Word, Silence can be invoked against any creature in range, preventing them from making a sound. No Saving Throw is allowed.~ 

@720 = ~Contingency
(General)

Level: 6
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent until triggered
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell, the wizard is allowed to choose a spell out of <PRO_HISHER> repertoire of known spells. One spell level every 3 levels of the caster is allowed—up to 6th-level spells at 18th level. Once the spell is chosen, the caster can choose a condition of some kind from the list provided. The starting condition can be anything from reaching 10% of <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points to an enemy being sighted. Once this starting condition is satisfied, the spell that was chosen will be cast automatically.

For example, a 12th-level wizard could place the spell Stoneskin in a Contingency with the starting condition being "the wizard reaches 50% of <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points." Once the wizard is reduced to 50% of <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points or below, Stoneskin would be immediately cast upon <PRO_HIMHER>. This requires no action by the wizard, but happens automatically and instantaneously.

A limitation of this spell is that the target of the spell placed in the contingency must be the caster. Therefore, it should not be an offensive spell, nor can it target any other party members.~ 

@721 = ~Trollish Fortitude
(Enchantment)

Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

@722 = ~Ruby Ray Of Reversal
(Abjuration)

Level: 7
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it dispels one spell protection of any level affecting the target creature. This will always remove the highest-level spell protection affecting the target; if more than one same-level protection is active on the target simultaneously, one of them will be randomly chosen and dispelled. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.

The spells affected by Ruby Ray Of Reversal are Minor Spell Turning, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Minor Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Spell Shield, Spell Deflection, and Spell Trap.~ 

@723 = ~Spell Sequencer
(General)

Level: 7
Range: 0
Duration: Permanent until activated
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows a wizard to store three spells and activate them all at the same time from <PRO_HISHER> Special Abilities menu. All spells must be of 4th level or lower. To create a sequencer, a wizard must memorize not only Spell Sequencer but the spells <PRO_HESHE> intends to store in it (a Sorcerer can store spells of any level for which <PRO_HESHE> still has spell slots). After casting Spell Sequencer, the player will be prompted to choose the sequenced spells from those <PRO_HESHE> has memorized.

A sequencer lasts until activated and, once used, releases its spells immediately (no casting time). The Special Abilities icon also disappears until the next time a sequencer is formed. A wizard can possess only one Spell Sequencer at a time, and it cannot be given to other characters.~

@724 = ~Prismatic Spray
(Evocation)

Level: 7
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 47-ft. cone with 90-deg. arc
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes shimmering rays of light to flash from the wizard's hand in a 47-ft. cone. Any creature touched by the rays may be inflicted with a random effect depending on the color (see below), but any creature with fewer than 8 Hit Dice is blinded for 5 rounds regardless of any additional effect. The colors of the prismatic spray do the following:

– Red: 20 magic damage (save vs. Spell for half)
– Orange: 40 magic damage (save vs. Spell for half)
– Yellow: 80 magic damage (save vs. Spell for half)
– Green: Save vs. Poison or die—survivors still take 20 poison damage
– Blue: Save vs. Petrification or turn to stone
– Indigo: Save vs. Wand or go insane~

@725 = ~Power Word, Stun
(Enchantment)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When Power Word, Stun is uttered,the targeted creature is stunned for a duration depending on its current Hit Points:

– Below 31: 4d4 rounds
– 31 to 60: 2d4 rounds
– 61 to 90: 1d4 rounds
– 91 or more: Unaffected

Because the spell checks the creature's current Hit Points, not its maximum, even the toughest creature can be affected by this spell if it is wounded.~
@726 = ~Limited Wish
(General)

Level: 7
Range: 0
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Limited Wish is a very potent but difficult spell. It will fulfill literally, but only partially or for a limited duration, the utterance of the spellcaster. Thus, the actuality of the past, present, or future might be altered (but possibly only for the wizard unless the wording of the spell is most carefully stated) in some limited manner. The use of Limited Wish will not substantially change major realities. The spell can, for example, restore some Hit Points lost by the wizard. Greedy desires usually end in disaster for the wisher.

The wiser the wizard, the better chance that <PRO_HESHE> will choose the right wording. Wizards with low Wisdom will more often than not meet with disaster when asking for a wish.~ 

@727 = ~Spell Trigger
(General)

Level: 8
Range: 0
Duration: Permanent until activated
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows a wizard to store spells in a magical ability (accessed via the Special Abilities menu) that is created by the spell. This item, the trigger, can store three spells to be released simultaneously, all of which must be of 6th level or lower. A wizard can only possess one spell trigger at a time, and the trigger cannot be given to other characters. Once the spell trigger is used, the icon will disappear from the Special Abilities button.~

@728 = ~Incendiary Cloud
(Conjuration)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 18-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell creates a billowing cloud of roaring flame. Any in the area of the spell must leave the cloud immediately or suffer 1d4 points of fire damage per level of the caster each round while in the area of effect, with a Save vs. Spell for half.~

@729 = ~Symbol, Fear
(Enchantment)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent until triggered
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

Symbol, Fear is a powerful enchantment that allows the wizard to inscribe a symbol on the ground or any other surface. The symbol will remain there until an opponent comes too close, at which point it will explode, causing all enemies within the area to make a Save vs. Spell at a -4 penalty or be affected by fear for 2 rounds + 1 round for every 3 levels of the caster.~ 

@730 = ~Power Word, Blind
(Enchantment)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1

@731 = ~Symbol, Stun
(Enchantment)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

Symbol, Stun is a powerful enchantment that allows the wizard to inscribe a symbol on the ground or any other surface. The symbol will remain there until an opponent comes too close, at which point it will explode, causing all enemies within the area to make a Save vs. Spell at a -4 penalty or be stunned for 2 rounds + 1 round for every 3 levels of the caster.~ 
@732 = ~Symbol, Death
(Enchantment)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

Symbol, Death is a powerful enchantment that allows the wizard to inscribe a symbol on the ground or any other surface. The symbol will remain there until an opponent comes too close, at which point it will explode, causing all enemies within the area to make a Save vs. Death or die. Creatures with more than 60 current Hit Points are immune to this effect.~

@733 = ~Chain Contingency
(General)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: Permanent until triggered
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Chain Contingency channels some of the magical energy of the wizard and releases it only under certain circumstances. Basically, the wizard chooses three spells to be released under a certain condition, such as seeing an enemy or being hit. When this condition occurs, all three spells are cast immediately. Unlike the 6th-level Contingency spell, the wizard can set the target to be <PRO_HIMHER>self, the last creature to hit <PRO_HIMHER>, or the nearest enemy. Spells of 8th level or lower can be used in the contingency.~

@734 = ~Power Word, Kill
(Enchantment)

Level: 9
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 12-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Power Word, Kill is perhaps the deadliest word of power. It kills up to two enemies with 31 to 60 Hit Points or a group of enemies with 30 or fewer Hit Points, up to a maximum of 120 Hit Points. The Hit Point checks are done against a creature's current Hit Points, not their maximum, so it will affect extremely tough creatures that have been wounded.~

@735 = ~Wish
(General)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Wish is a more potent version of the Limited Wish spell. It will fulfill literally the utterance of the spellcaster. Thus, the actuality of the past, present, or future might be altered (but possibly only for the wizard unless the wording of the spell is most carefully stated) in some limited manner. Greedy desires usually end in disaster for the wisher.

@736 = ~Minor Sequencer
(General)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: Permanent until activated
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows a wizard to store two spells and activate them both at the same time from <PRO_HISHER> Special Abilities menu. Both spells must be of 2nd level or lower. To create a sequencer, a wizard must memorize not only Minor Sequencer but the spells <PRO_HESHE> intends to store in it (a Sorcerer can store spells of any level for which <PRO_HESHE> still has spell slots). After casting Minor Sequencer, the player will be prompted to choose the sequenced spells from those <PRO_HESHE> has memorized.

A sequencer lasts until activated and, once used, releases its spells immediately (no casting time). The Special Abilities icon also disappears until the next time a sequencer is formed. A wizard can possess only one Minor Sequencer at a time, and it cannot be given to other characters.~

Magi are perfectionists, and they welcome any opportunity to hone their powerful abilities further.

Wizards are rarely seen adventuring without a retinue of fighters and men-at-arms. Because there are different types (or schools) of magic, there are different types of wizards.

(Invocation/Evocation)

Level: 1
Range: Special
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is the Wild Mage's ultimate last-resort spell. When cast, the Mage releases a sudden flood of wild magical energy in the hope of seizing and shaping that energy into a desired spell effect. The attempt usually fails, but something almost always occurs in the process.

To use Nahal's Reckless Dweomer simply cast it, then choose from your list of known spells. A burst of magical energy is released, which the Wild Mage will try to manipulate into the desired form. The actual effect of the spell is determined randomly by a dice roll on the Wild Surge Table (see the manual for more details).

Because the release of energy is planned by the Mage, <PRO_HISHER> level is added to the dice roll. If the result indicates success, the Mage has shaped the magical energy into the desired effect. More often than not, the effect is completely unexpected. The result might be beneficial to the Mage, or it might be completely disastrous: This is the risk the Mage takes in casting Nahal's Reckless Dweomer.~

@115222 = ~Artificer~
@115223 = ~ARTIFICER: Artificers are gnomish inventers that supplement their spellcasting with a strange and obscure magic called 'science'.  They channel their magic through powerful devices that they construct from spare parts that they find laying around.  A well prepared aritficer is an devistaing opponent.  However, they are less practiced as casting spells 'raw' than other casters.  As such, their casting level is 1/2 their class level, rounded up.

Advantages
-
- Efficient Crafting: Starting at level 6, artificers can craft and recharge items at half the cost
Disadvantages
-  Artificers cast spells at 1/2 their illusionist level.
-  Artificers do not gain an extra slot as normal for a specialist  ~
